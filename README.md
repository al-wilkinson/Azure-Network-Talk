## Introduction
This repo is the work in progress for an upcoming talk covering basic aspects of Azure networking and Terraform IaC.

The .tf files have been designed so that they can be, in effect, commented out by renaming the .tf extension leaving a working repo that will deploy with ```terraform apply```

The prerequesites to installing are an Azure account and installed Terraform.
